                       User-Visible kstart Changes

kstart 4.2 (2015-12-25)

    k5start, when run with the -K option to run as a daemon, no longer
    exits if the initial authentication fails (unless -x was given).
    Instead, it reports the error to standard error and then continues to
    run, attempting authentication every minute as if authentication had
    failed after it had started.  Patch from Rasmus Borup Hansen.

    For both k5start with a command or -K and no -x flag, and krenew with
    the -i flag, repeatedly retry the initial authentication.  The first
    retry will be immediate, and then the commands will keep trying with
    exponential backoff to one minute intervals, and then continuously at
    one minute intervals until the command is killed or authentication
    succeeds.  k5start and krenew will no longer start any other command
    until the initial authentication succeeds, fixing startup behavior
    when running a command that must have valid Kerberos tickets
    immediately on start.  Based on a patch by Lars Hanke.

    Clean up the temporary ticket cache on k5start failure if -o, -g, or
    -m were given.  Based on a patch by Rasmus Borup Hansen.

    The -H flag to k5start or krenew may now be used in conjunction with
    -K and controls whether the ticket is renewed when the command wakes
    up.  Normally, the ticket will be renewed if it will expire sooner
    than two minutes after the next time the command will wake up.  If -H
    is specified, its value replaces the default value of two minutes.
    Patch from Michael Lass.

    Add a new -a option to both k5start and krenew that, when used with
    -K, tells those programs to refresh tickets every time they wake up.
    This is useful with -t to ensure that the AFS token renewal program is
    always run, even if something else renews the ticket cache before
    k5start or krenew wake up.  It also provides more predictable ticket
    refresh behavior.  This probably should have been the default with -K
    from the beginning, but the default wasn't changed to keep backward
    compatibility.  Consider always using -a with -K.  Based on a patch by
    Andrew Deason.

    Fix k5start and krenew to not incorrectly reject the -b flag in
    conjunction with -K or a command.  Patch from Lars Hanke.

    Update to rra-c-util 5.9:

    * Add missing va_end to xasprintf implementation.
    * Improve portability to Kerberos included in Solaris 10.
    * Use appropriate warning flags with Clang (currently not warning clean).
    * Use Lancaster Consensus environment variables to control tests.
    * Use calloc or reallocarray for protection against integer overflows.
    * Suppress warnings from Kerberos headers in non-system paths.
    * Assume calloc initializes pointers to NULL.
    * Assume free(NULL) is properly ignored.
    * Improve error handling in xasprintf and xvasprintf.
    * Check the return status of snprintf and vsnprintf properly.
    * Preserve errno if snprintf fails in vasprintf replacement.
    * Fix probing for Heimdal's libroken to work with older versions.
    * Improve POD tests.
    * Fix kafs compilation failure on Solaris 11 or later.
    * Drop concat from the util library in favor of asprintf.
    * Fail on any error in [bx]asprintf and [bx]vasprintf.
    * Pass --deps to krb5-config in the non-reduced-dependencies case.
    * Silence __attribute__ warnings on more compilers.

    Update to C TAP Harness 3.4:

    * Fix segfault in runtests with an empty test list.
    * Display verbose test results with -v or C_TAP_VERBOSE.
    * Support comments and blank lines in test lists.
    * Check for integer overflow on memory allocations.
    * Reopen standard input to /dev/null when running a test list.
    * Don't leak extraneous file descriptors to tests.
    * Suppress lazy plans and test summaries if the test failed with bail.
    * runtests now treats the command line as a list of tests by default.
    * The full test executable path can now be passed to runtests -o.
    * Improved harness output for tests with lazy plans.
    * Improved harness output to a terminal for some abort cases.
    * Flush harness output after each test even when not on a terminal.
    * Only use feature-test macros when requested or built with gcc -ansi.
    * Drop is_double from the C TAP library to avoid requiring -lm.
    * Avoid using local in the shell libtap.sh library.
    * Silence __attribute__ warnings on more compilers.
    * runtests now frees all allocated resources on exit.

kstart 4.1 (2012-01-07)

    Fix a regression introduced in kstart 4.0 that caused k5start -H and
    krenew -H to fail and attempt reauthentication with non-renewable
    tickets even if the lifetime was long enough.  Thanks to pod for the
    report.

    Fix a regression introduced in kstart 4.0 where k5start -H would be
    happy with an unexpired ticket for a different principal than the
    desired client principal.

    When k5start or krenew are running as a daemon and obtaining new
    tickets fails, both now shorten the wake-up interval to one minute and
    keep trying at that interval until the error resolves itself, and then
    go back to the normal wakeup interval.

    Add a new -s option to krenew that, if given, tells krenew to send
    SIGHUP to the command it's running when it exits because it can't
    renew the ticket.  This is useful when continuing to run the command
    without a valid ticket would be pointless.

    After a SIGHUP or SIGTERM when not running a command, k5start and
    krenew now clean up their PID files, if any, before exiting.

kstart 4.0 (2011-12-29)

    Remove k4start from the distribution.  I no longer have a Kerberos v4
    environment with which to test and therefore no way to refactor and
    restructure the code for other changes to the package.  Users who
    still need k4start should use an older version of the package.

    Ticket caches passed to k5start or krenew with the -k option are now
    used as-is without prepending "FILE:".  This allows both programs to
    be used with non-file caches (unles the -o, -g, or -m options were
    given to k5start, of course).  However, users who were relying on
    k5start or krenew prepending "FILE:" may now need to add this
    explicitly to the -k argument if they want the ticket cache to be set
    in the environment with that prefix.

    Always canonicalize the ticket cache name in k5start before
    propagating KRB5CCNAME to child processes.  This combined with the
    previous change allows -k to specify a ticket cache name that changes
    once the cache is created, such as when creating new PIPE caches.

    krenew now defaults to staying running if renewing credentials fails.
    The new -x option restores the previous behavior of exiting on any
    error.  It will still exit by default (unless -i is used) if the
    renewable lifetime has expired or if the ticket cache has been
    removed.

    k5start no longer exits on failure to obtain credentials when running
    as a daemon.  The new -x option restores the previous behavior of
    exiting on any error.  It does still exit if the first attempt to
    obtain credentials during startup (before backgrounding) fails, to
    make it easier to diagnose configuration errors.

    k5start, when run with the -o, -g, or -m options to change ticket
    cache ownership or permissions, now writes a temporary ticket cache in
    the same directory, sets its ownership and permissions, and then
    replaces the existing cache with an atomic rename.  It also sets
    permissions properly if it has to reauthenticate after backgrounding
    itself.  This closes two windows where the cache may not be accessible
    to the program using it if k5start were in the middle of refreshing
    it.  Thanks to Harry Coin for the report.

    k5start and krenew now propagate SIGINT (Ctrl-C) to the child process
    when running a command rather than exiting immediately.

    Set signal handlers with sigaction instead of signal, which may fix
    problems propagating multiple signals to child processes in k5start
    and krenew.

    Diagnose the nonsensical combination of -U and -u or -i options in
    k5start and report an error rather than ignoring -u and appending the
    instance from -i onto the principal obtained via -U.  Also diagnose
    the non-sensical combination of -H and a command to run in both
    k5start and krenew; just omit the -H flag for this case.

    Update the included kafs library to the version from rra-c-util 4.0,
    adding support for Mac OS X and Solaris 11.

    Change references to Kerberos v5 to just Kerberos in the
    documentation.  Kerberos v5 has been the default version of Kerberos
    for over ten years now.

    Update to rra-c-util 4.0:

    * Build on systems where krb5/krb5.h exists but krb5.h does not.
    * Build with OpenBSD Heimdal where there is no separate roken library.
    * Kerberos probes no longer assume transitive library dependencies.
    * Fix removal of /usr/include from Kerberos CPPFLAGS.
    * Add notices to all files copied from rra-c-util.
    * Fix replacement of krb5_free_error_message.
    * Support older Heimdal with no-context krb5_get_init_creds_opt_free.
    * Improve probe for krb5_kt_free_entry.
    * Fix use of long long, where available, in replacement mkstemp.
    * Include strings.h where present for more POSIX string functions.
    * Use typedef for a missing sig_atomic_t.
    * Avoid passing a NULL context to krb5_get_error_message.
    * Fix integer data types in the messages utility library.
    * Use configure-detected aklog path in the test suite.
    * Add replacement for a missing strndup (such as on Mac OS X).
    * Add tests for messages-krb5 utility functions.
    * Update compiler warning flags for make warnings to gcc 4.6.1.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.9:

    * Add a usage message and -h option to runtests.
    * Honor -s and SOURCE in runtests even if BUILD is not set.
    * Improve test summary at the end of a C test case.
    * Flush stderr before printing TAP output.
    * Improve portability of output functions in the shell libtap.sh.
    * Add notices to all files copied from C TAP Harness.

kstart 3.16 (2010-01-19)

    Add the -L option to k5start and krenew, saying to log messages to
    syslog as well as standard output or standard error.

    Correctly set the ticket cache path in k5start when the -k option was
    not given, fixing a NULL pointer dereference when the -o, -g, or -m
    options were given without -k.  Thanks, Garrett Wollman.

    Allow the argument to -k to start with FILE: and strip off that prefix
    to form the ticket cache name.  -k still forces its argument to be a
    file-based cache, however; FILE: is the only cache type designator
    supported.  Use the KRB5CCNAME environment variable for other ticket
    cache types.

    k5start and krenew now say, in -h output, if they will attempt to
    create a new AFS PAG for commands run in combination with -t (enabled
    by --enable-setpag), allowing one to determine whether that support
    was compiled in.

    Include the proper header for signal handling functions, fixing a
    build problem on Solaris 9.  Thanks, Tim Bishop.

    Avoid Heimdal functions marked as deprecated.  Also fix the test suite
    to pass with Heimdal user space.

    Update to rra-c-util 2.2:

    * Add GCC function attributes alloc_size, malloc, and nonnull.
    * Use AC_TYPE_LONG_LONG_INT instead of AC_CHECK_TYPES([long long]).

kstart 3.15 (2009-08-15)

    k5start and krenew now catch SIGALRM and immediately refresh the
    ticket cache upon receiving it, even if the ticket isn't expired.

    Add the -i option to krenew, which says to keep running even if there
    is an error renewing the ticket cache.  This is useful if the ticket
    cache renewed by krenew may expire and then later be renewed (such as
    with a manual kinit) and krenew is expected to wake up again and
    process the new ticket cache.

    Re-run aklog even if the ticket is still valid when -H is used in
    combination with -t.  We don't check whether the token is valid, so
    it's safer to always re-run aklog.  We may be setting a token in a new
    PAG using an existing ticket cache.

    Fail with an error rather than a segfault if MIT Kerberos is unable to
    determine a default local realm for an unqualified principal.  Based
    on a patch from Jason Funk.

    Add example krenew-agent script, which runs krenew for a given ticket
    cache if it isn't already running.  Contributed by Tim Skirvin.

    Correctly declare message_fatal_cleanup extern, fixing compilation
    problems on some platforms (particularly Mac OS X).

    Document that the -b flag to all programs also changes directories to
    / and any paths should therefore be absolute.

    Add support for the old Heimdal krb5_get_error_string interface.
    Thanks, Chaskiel Grundman.

    Fix some timing issues with the test suite that caused spurious
    failures on fast systems and try to make it more robust in the face of
    different process scheduling.  This probably still isn't perfect.

    k4start is now built optionally based on whether Kerberos v4 libraries
    are available, removing the need for --disable-k4start if no Kerberos
    v4 libraries are present.  The option is still supported to explicitly
    disable building k4start even if Kerberos v4 libraries are found.

    Enable Automake silent rules.  For a quieter build, pass the
    --enable-silent-rules option to configure or build with make V=0.

    Update to rra-c-util 2.0:

    * Redo build system for kafs replacement library and add tests.
    * Add --with-libkafs-include and --with-libkafs-lib configure options.
    * Add --with-afs-include and --with-afs-lib configure options.
    * Sanity-check the results of krb5-config before proceeding.
    * Fall back on manual probing if krb5-config results don't work.
    * Add --with-krb5-include and --with-krb5-lib configure options.
    * Add --with-krb4-include and --with-krb4-lib configure options.
    * Don't break if the user clobbers CPPFLAGS at build time.
    * Provide a proper bool type with Sun Studio 12 on Solaris 10.
    * Change AC_TRY_* to AC_*_IFELSE as recommended by Autoconf.
    * Add strlcpy, strlcat, and setenv replacements.
    * Fix open call parameters in daemon portability test.
    * Update portable and util test suite for C TAP Harness 1.1.

    Update to C TAP Harness 1.1:

    * Rewrite of all test cases to use the new TAP library support.
    * Much improved and simplified builddir != srcdir test suite support.
    * Support running a single test with tests/runtests -o.
    * Summarize results at the end of test executions.
    * Correctly handle completely skipped tests, like docs/pod.
    * Better reporting of fatal errors in the test suite.
    * Consume all output from a test case before closing its descriptor.
    * Support aspell for spelling tests and skip them by default.

kstart 3.14 (2008-07-22)

    Add -F and -P options to k5start to force the tickets to not be
    forwardable or proxiable, regardless of library defaults.  This can be
    necessary if one's krb5.conf defaults to forwardable or proxiable
    tickets but service principals aren't allowed to get such tickets.

kstart 3.13 (2008-05-28)

    As of this release, k4start should be considered frozen.  I will still
    fix bugs where possible, but it is no longer tested before releases
    and new features added to k5start and krenew will not be added to
    k4start.

    If the environment variable AKLOG is set, use its value as the path to
    the aklog program to run when -t is given to k5start or krenew.  If
    AKLOG is set, always run that program unless -n was given in k4start.
    This environment variable replaces the badly-named KINIT_PROG,
    although KINIT_PROG is still supported for backward compatibility.

    Remove the restriction that -o, -g, and -m may not be used with -K or
    a command.  The MIT Kerberos libraries have removed the restriction
    about ticket cache ownership and this now works properly.  However,
    each authentication changes the permissions, so reset the ownership
    and permissions whenever we renew the cache.  Thanks, Howard
    Wilkinson.

    Strip a leading FILE: or WRFILE: prefix from the ticket cache name
    when changing the ownership or permissions.  Based on a patch from
    Howard Wilkinson.

    Fix a portability problem with Heimdal introduced in the previous
    release (Heimdal wants krb5_cc_copy_cache, not krb5_cc_copy_creds).
    Thanks, Jason White.

    Include a dummy object in libportable to avoid build failures on
    systems that don't need any portability functions (such as Mac OS X).

kstart 3.12 (2008-04-23)

    krenew, when running a command, first copies the current ticket cache
    to a private cache for that command so that it will be unaffected by
    later destruction of the cache (such as by user logout).  The private
    cache is deleted when the command exits.

    Fix problems with command-line parsing in k4start and k5start that
    led to treating a provided command as a principal in some situations.
    Allow for getopt() implementations that don't strip the -- argument
    if it occurs after the first non-option (such as on at least older
    Solaris).

    k5start now uses krb5_cc_destroy() rather than unlink to clean up the
    ticket cache when necessary.

    Fix multiple problems with the libkafs and AFS system call checks
    on platforms other than Linux that caused the libraries to leak into
    the global LIBS and include checks done without the AFS include
    paths.

    Fix the ordering of LDFLAGS to avoid accidentally linking with the
    AFS com_err library and ensure the AFS syscall layer is built with
    the right CPPFLAGS.

    If KRB5_CONFIG was explicitly set in the environment, don't use a
    different krb5-config based on --with-krb4 or --with-krb5.  If
    krb5-config isn't executable, don't use it.  This allows one to
    force library probing by setting KRB5_CONFIG to point to a
    nonexistent file.

    Sanity-check the results of krb5-config before proceeding and error
    out in configure if they don't work.

    Fix Autoconf syntax error when probing for libkrb5support.  Thanks,
    Mike Garrison.

kstart 3.11 (2008-04-10)

    Add a -c option to k4start, k5start, and krenew, which writes out the
    PID of the child process when running a command.  This is similar to
    -p, but writes out the command PID rather than the PID of k4start,
    k5start, or krenew.  Based on a patch by Sascha Tandel.

    Add a -H option to krenew that works similarly to the -H option for
    k5start: checking whether the remaining lifetime of the ticket is
    already long enough, only renewing if it isn't, and exiting with a
    status indicating whether the resulting ticket had a sufficiently long
    lifetime.  Based on a patch by Gautam Iyer.

    Add -o, -g, and -m options to k4start and k5start to set the owner,
    group, and mode of the ticket cache after creation.  These options
    cannot be used with a specified command or with -K since, after making
    those changes, the Kerberos library won't permit reading or writing to
    the ticket cache.  Based on a patch by Howard Wilkinson.

    Significantly update the AFS setpag support.  The option to build with
    AFS setpag support is now --enable-setpag.  On most platforms, if
    libkafs is not found, kstart uses an internal AFS system call
    implementation that doesn't require linking with the AFS libraries.
    The AFS libraries are used only on AIX and IRIX.  On platforms other
    than Linux, pass --with-afs to configure to specify the location of
    the AFS include files and libraries.

    Redo the build machinery for Kerberos v4 and Kerberos v5 libraries to
    take advantage of portability improvements from other projects.
    kstart will now hopefully build with AIX's Kerberos libraries and get
    more of the edge cases right.  Instead of --with-kerberos, use
    --with-krb5 to specify the path to the Kerberos v5 libraries and
    --with-krb4 to specify the path to the Kerberos v4 libraries.

    After backgrounding, reauthenticate if necessary before writing out
    the PID file in case we need tickets or tokens to write the file.

    Close the keytab after determining the principal with k5start -U.

    --enable-static is no longer supported.  This is generally unnecessary
    and complex to support in combination with other options.

    kstart now has a basic test suite, although not all functionality is
    tested yet.  See README and tests/data/README for information on how
    to enable the tests that are there.

kstart 3.10 (2007-04-10)

    Fix compilation error with a new enough MIT Kerberos to support
    krb5_get_error_message and with et/com_err.h instead of com_err.h
    (such as Fedora Core 6).  Thanks, Stefan Foerster.

    Rework the configure script to use AS_IF instead of explicit if
    statements, which allows Autoconf to do better dependency analysis.

kstart 3.9 (2007-03-02)

    Separate authenticating from running aklog in k4start, k5start, and
    krenew.  Just because we have a valid ticket cache doesn't mean that
    we already have a token since we just created a new PAG.  If running
    aklog was requested, always do so even if we didn't get new tickets.

kstart 3.8 (2007-03-02)

    Allow -H to be used with a command in k4start and k5start.  In this
    case, check the existing ticket cache and authenticate if it's stale,
    then run the command in either case.  This is useful when running
    several commands with the same credentials at near the same time.  It
    reduces Kerberos traffic and avoids service ticket requests being
    rejected as possible relay attacks.

    Support the new MIT Kerberos error message functions.

    Overhaul the build system.  Use Automake, use a better strategy for
    dealing with portability issues, and factor duplicate code out into
    shared files.

kstart 3.7 (2007-01-28)

    Correctly honor the argument to -H for k4start and k5start.  This was
    lost during an earlier code restructuring.  Thanks to Thomas Weiss for
    the bug report.

    Document that -K will renew a ticket if it will expire within two
    minutes of the next wakeup, not just if it will expire before the next
    wakeup.

kstart 3.6 (2006-10-04)

    Call k_hasafs before k_setpag in builds with the kafs functions.
    Without calling k_hasafs first, k_setpag may fail or die with a
    signal.  Thanks to Thomas Kula for the bug report.

    Document in the man pages when a new PAG is created.

    Avoid $< in non-pattern rules.  This doesn't work with some non-GNU
    makes.

kstart 3.5 (2006-06-13)

    When invoked to run a command, k4start, k5start, and krenew now
    propagate HUP, TERM, and QUIT signals to the child process rather than
    just exiting.  These signals do not terminate k4start, k5start, or
    krenew any longer, but of course they will exit if the signal causes
    the child process to exit.  Patch from Adam Megacz.

    Minor Makefile updates to support Autoconf 2.60.

kstart 3.4 (2006-05-05)

    k5start now rechecks the ticket cache and possibly reauthenticates
    after backgrounding itself when running as a daemon.  This works
    around the loss of the ticket cache after backgrounding on Mac OS X
    with the default ticket cache type.

    Force the use of a file ticket cache in k5start and krenew if the -k
    option is given.  The code was assuming that a file ticket cache was
    the default, which may not always be the case.

    Document in the krenew man page that the -b option may not do what one
    desires on Mac OS X and suggest an alternative that doesn't detach
    from the current session.

    krenew no longer runs aklog unless the -t flag was given.  Previously,
    due to a bug, it would skip running aklog the first time unless -t was
    given but would then always run aklog if either a compiled-in default
    or a default from the environment were available.

kstart 3.3 (2006-04-10)

    Add a missing <stdarg.h> include that caused compilation failures on
    OS X in krenew and could have led to latent problems on other
    platforms.

    Clarify that the DIR argument to --with-afs-setpag is optional in
    configure --help output.

kstart 3.2 (2006-03-05)

    Revert the -g feature.  MIT Kerberos refuses to use ticket caches not
    owned by the running process, removing the usefulness of the feature,
    and a bug in its implementation was causing k5start and krenew to not
    run aklog when they should.

kstart 3.1 (2006-02-23)

    Add the -g flag to k5start and krenew to make the ticket cache
    group-readable.  This is useful for maintaining a ticket cache shared
    by multiple automated processes on the same host running as different
    users (such as Mailman).

kstart 3.0 (2006-01-22)

    Add a krenew command that acts like k5start except that it uses an
    existing ticket cache and just renews it.

    Don't check the executability of the aklog program before running it,
    as this prevents people from configuring aklog programs that include
    flags.

    Add a -h flag to all programs to display the usage message and exit.

    Report the compiled aklog path in usage output.

kstart 2.9 (2006-01-01)

    Improved error handling when using Heimdal and clearer formatting with
    any Kerberos implementation.  Use krb5_err and krb5_warn functions
    always and provide replacements when using MIT Kerberos.

    Significantly improved Kerberos library probes.  Use krb5-config where
    available to get Kerberos libraries and compiler flags unless
    --enable-reduced-depends or --enable-static are used, and support MIT
    Kerberos 1.4 with --enable-static.

    Add the --enable-reduced-depends configure option to try to minimize
    the shared library dependencies of the resulting binaries on platforms
    with proper shared library dependencies.  This is of interest
    primarily to people building packages for distributions.

    AFS setpag support no longer requires linking with pthreads and also
    supports the Heimdal or KTH libkafs library as a source of setpag.

    Ported to systems that require sys/time.h be included instead of
    time.h (Tru64 4.0 in particular).

    Attempt better portability to KTH Kerberos installs that build their
    own DES library rather than using OpenSSL.

    Included a spec file for RPM builds, contributed by Buck Huppmann.

kstart 2.8 (2005-08-09)

    Added the -b option to both k4start and k5start to background after
    the initial authentication.  Added the -p option to both k4start and
    k5start to save the PID of the process in a file.  Both were based on
    code by Navid Golpayegani.

    -p is no longer accepted as a synonym for -s (this synonym was never
    documented).

kstart 2.7 (2005-06-04)

    Fixed a bug in k5start introduced in 2.4 that broke -H handling and
    getting a specific service ticket, and which caused k5start to make an
    additional bogus request for the wrong service on each authentication.

kstart 2.6 (2005-06-03)

    Finished the port to Heimdal.  k5start error reporting should now work
    correctly, as should handling of krb5.conf defaults.

    Added the -U flag to k5start, telling it to figure out the client
    principal by looking in the provided keytab rather than expecting it
    on the command line, making it easier to write scripts that use the
    system keytab.

    Added the --disable-k4start flag to configure to make it easier to
    build only k5start (particularly useful if one only has Heimdal and
    not KTH Kerberos).

kstart 2.5 (2005-05-01)

    Unless -k is given, k4start and k5start both now create a temporary
    ticket cache file with mkstemp and delete it on exit when running a
    command, to not interfere with other ticket caches owned by the same
    user.

    k5start now correctly sets KRB5CCNAME when running aklog or a
    command.

    Ported to Heimdal and KTH Kerberos, somewhat.  Error handling in
    k5start still won't produce good error messages because the
    differences between MIT and Heimdal are more profound than I can
    easily adjust for.

    Documentation improvements, particularly in the area of specifying
    commands to run.

kstart 2.4 (2005-04-25)

    Renamed kstart to k4start to avoid a conflict with a KDE program.
    This is more symmetric with k5start anyway.

    Added support to both k4start and k5start for running a program after
    obtaining Kerberos credentials and optionally AFS tokens.  This mode
    is like the -K mode, except that k4start or k5start will exit when the
    program it ran exits.  Added preliminary support for creating a PAG
    for the command to run in.

    Minor cleanups and bug fixes to both programs.  Exit earlier if unable
    to determine the principal, add newlines to the end of some verbose
    trace messages, and fix error reporting after Ctrl-C in k4start.

    Internal code refactoring, reorganization, and cleanup.

kstart 2.3 (2005-02-22)

    Fixed make install with a separate build directory.  The Makefile must
    look for the man pages in the source directory.

    Don't include Debian packaging rules in the standard distribution (per
    recommended best practices for maintaining Debian packages with rules
    in the upstream CVS).

kstart 2.2 (2004-07-29)

    Removed the various Stanford-specific banners that these programs
    inherited from our local kinit.  In normal use of kstart or k5start,
    there's no need to check for whether the session is encrypted (and the
    relevant environment variables are normally not set anyway).
    Similarly, since there's only one kstart and k5start, there isn't the
    need to distinguish from another by printing out a Stanford banner.

    Added Debian package build rules.

    Significantly improved the man pages.

    Substantial code cleanup of both kstart and k5start.  Both now follow
    my current C coding standards, include far less portability cruft, and
    include far fewer unnecessary headers.

kstart 2.1 (2002-12-29)

    No code changes.  Added a README file with installation instructions
    and a license.

kstart 2.0 (2002-12-29)

    First release that includes k5start, an equivalent version of kstart
    for Kerberos v5.

kstart 1.19 (2001-06-14)

    Added a fudge factor to make sure the ticket is refreshed before it
    expires.  The same factor also applies to -H, so -H will detect
    tickets that are about to expire.

kstart 1.17 (2001-01-16)

    Fixed a bug in obtaining a ticket from a srvtab.

kstart 1.16 (2000-10-17)

    Added the -H option to check whether a ticket has expired, and fix
    bugs in the detection of expired tickets.

kstart 1.13 (2000-04-19)

    Diagnose errors when running aklog.  Better portability and use of
    Autoconf.

kstart 1.10 (1999-09-01)

    Set KRBTKFILE when -k is used so that aklog can find the ticket.

kstart 1.8 (1997-10-17)

    Add support for long-term ticket maintenance as a daemon, the -K and
    -k options.

kstart 1.7 (1997-07-23)

    Change default location of aklog and documentation fixes.

kstart 1.5 (1996-04-10)

    Portability to Solaris.  Change the usage message to indicate that
    lifetime is in minutes, not seconds.

kstart 1.3 (1995-06-05)

    Add a password prompt for the -s option and remove implied -q.
