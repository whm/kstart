kstart (3.14-2) unstable; urgency=low

  As of this release, k4start is no longer included since Debian no longer
  includes any Kerberos v4 libraries.  All sites still using Kerberos v4
  should place a high priority on migrating to Kerberos v5; v4 is no
  longer supported and has known significant security weaknesses.
