This directory contains data used by kstart's test suite.

To enable tests that require Kerberos authentication and a working
end-to-end Kerberos environment, create a Kerberos keytab in the local
realm and put it in this directory as test.keytab.  Then, create a file
named test.principal and in it put the principal name corresponding to the
key in the keytab on a single line ending with a newline.  The presence of
these two files will enable the tests that actually do Kerberos
authentication.

In order to test AFS PAG and token handling (only applicable if built with
--enable-setpag), be sure that you have an AFS token before you run the
test suite.  (It doesn't matter which user you have an AFS token for.)

If you are building in a different directory tree than the source tree,
don't put the files in this directory.  Instead, after running configure,
you will have an empty tests/data directory in your build tree.  Put the
test.keytab and test.principal files in that directory instead.
